#Two mutually exclusive cytidine-to-thymidine mutations, C228T and C250T (chr5:1295228 C>T and 1295250 C>T; hg19), positioned at 124 and 146 base pairs upstream of the ATG translational start site of TERT, respectively, are found in ~70% of melanomas, 80¨C90% of glioblastoma multiforme, 60% of hepatocellular carcinoma, 60% of bladder cancer, 70% of basal cell carcinoma, 50% of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and up to 30% of thyroid cancers. Other recurrent but much less frequent mutations in the TERT promoter (occurring at positions chr5: 1295228 C>A, 1295242¨C1295243 CC>TT and 1295161A>C) have also been observed.
